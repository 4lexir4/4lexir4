Hello there 

I am a PhD-qualified applied mathematician with 13+ years of diverse research and development experience - for details please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-ira-phd-657bab166/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r21toV4AAAAJ&hl=en) profile. 

My [PhD Thesis](https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/items/5f1d0a83-7801-5b7f-bee8-5f7836953a69) was in optimal control and its application in networked nonlinear dynamical systems - please note that I have legally chagned my name from Merid Lje≈°njanin to Alex Ira in 2017. 

I worked on various problems, including but not limited to:
 - (deep) machine learning
 - tracking (Kalman filter and its flavoures, Partical filter)
 - estimation
 - time series forecasting
 - assigners (constrained optimisation)
 - collision avoidance
 - path planning
 - anomaly detection
 - iterative learning 
 - model predictive control
 - extremum seeking control
 - networked control systems
 - guidance, navigation and control (GNC)

I am also skilled in utilising modern software tools ((any) unix OS + ${\textsf{\color{green}tmux}}$ + ${\textsf{\color{Cerulean}neo}}{\textsf{\color{lightgreen}vim}}$) and development processes, with the focus on Python, Go and Rust. 

My current interest is in the finance and trading algorithms, systems and the corresponding theory.
