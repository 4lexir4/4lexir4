Hi there

I am a PhD-qualified applied mathematician with 13+ years of diverse research and development experience - for details please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-ira-phd-657bab166/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r21toV4AAAAJ&hl=en) profile. My [PhD Thesis](https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/items/5f1d0a83-7801-5b7f-bee8-5f7836953a69) was in optimal control and its application in networked nonlinear dynamical systems (please note that I have legally chagned my name from Merid Lje≈°njanin to Alex Ira in 2017 - my thesis is in my old name), but I have also worked on problems involving (Deep) Machine Learning, Data Science, Time Series, Algorithms and Optimisation. In terms of programming languages at the moment I am focusing on Python, Go and Rust, but I have had experience with Julia, C, C++, JavaScript and MATLAB/Simulink.
