Hi there 

I am a PhD-qualified applied mathematician with 13+ years of diverse research and development experience - for details please see my LinkedIn profile. My PhD was in optimal control and its application in networked systems. Over the years I've obtained expertise in Machine Learning, Time Series, Algorithms, Optimisation and Control Theory. I am also skilled in utilising modern software tools ((any) unix OS + ${\textsf{\color{green}tmux}}$ + ${\textsf{\color{Cerulean}neo}}{\textsf{\color{lightgreen}vim}}$) and development processes, with the focus on Python, Go and Rust. I'm genuinely interested in and excited about finance and trading algorithms, systems and the corrsponding theory.
