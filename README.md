Hello there 

I am a PhD-qualified applied mathematician with 13+ years of diverse research and development experience - for details please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-ira-phd-657bab166/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r21toV4AAAAJ&hl=en) profile. 

My [PhD Thesis](https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/items/5f1d0a83-7801-5b7f-bee8-5f7836953a69) was in optimal control and its application in networked nonlinear dynamical systems - please note that I have legally chagned my name from Merid Lje≈°njanin to Alex Ira in 2017. 

I worked on various guidance, navigation and control (GNC) problems, tracking problems, collision avoidance problems, path planning problems, anomaly detection problems, assigner problems, (deep) machine learning problems, iterative learning problems, model predictive control problems and networked control system problems. For these I used tools such as (Deep) Machine Learning, Estimation, Filters, Optimisation, Time Series Analysis etc. 

I am also skilled in utilising modern software tools ((any) unix OS + ${\textsf{\color{green}tmux}}$ + ${\textsf{\color{Cerulean}neo}}{\textsf{\color{lightgreen}vim}}$) and development processes, with the focus on Python, Go and Rust. 

My current interest is in the finance and trading algorithms, systems and the corresponding theory.
