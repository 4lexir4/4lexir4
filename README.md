Hello there 

I am a PhD-qualified applied mathematician with 13+ years of diverse research and development experience - for details please see my LinkedIn profile. My PhD was in optimal control and its application in networked nonlinear dynamical systems. In addition ot control theory, over the years, I have obtained expertise in (Deep) Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis, Estimation, Algorithms and Optimisation. I am also skilled in utilising modern software tools ((any) unix OS + ${\textsf{\color{green}tmux}}$ + ${\textsf{\color{Cerulean}neo}}{\textsf{\color{lightgreen}vim}}$) and development processes, with the focus on Python, Go and Rust. I am genuinely interested in and excited about finance and trading algorithms, systems and the corrsponding theory.
